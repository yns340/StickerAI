StickerAI is a mobile app developed for learning Swift and CoreML.  
It cartoonizes images uploaded by users using CoreML models.  
Users can then use these cartoonized images as stickers in their chats or social media.

## Features

- Image upload and processing with CoreML  
- Cartoon-style transformation  
- Sticker export functionality  

## Technologies Used

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- CoreML  
- UIKit 

## Third-Party Libraries and Models

This project uses the [AnimeGANv2 PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/bryandlee/animegan2-pytorch) by Bryan Lee for image cartoonization.


## Purpose

This app was developed to gain hands-on experience in iOS app development and to explore the integration of AI technologies using CoreML.  
It served as a learning project to better understand the iOS development ecosystem and prepare myself for AI-related projects.
